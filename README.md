# GDB_Exhibitions
this is the read me for this project, im testing to see how stuff works and if i can relenquish control of this to other people.
this repository is under a project that is also owned by me so if there are problems with that lmk
with github you are able to to create forks which are branches of code you work on that keep the original base code so to speak
test before commiting to a fork
update if there are discoveries this is new to me too
